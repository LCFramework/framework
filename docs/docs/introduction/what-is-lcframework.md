# What is LCFramework?

LCFramework is a framework that provides extendable foundations to build a modern 
web-based ecosystem around your LastChaos private server. It's built on the
[Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, thus enabling you to utilise the same 
APIs and functionality that Laravel offers.

::: warning
LCFramework is currently in `alpha` status. This means there may be bugs,
and the API may still change between minor versions.

## Motivation

TL;DR - the LastChaos development scene is not welcoming to newcomers, and a lot of 
the material that is readily available, is built on ancient technologies and tools, 
resulting in critical vulnerabilities.

LCFramework was not only built to allow server owners to easily manage their own websites, 
enabling every site to have a unique appearance (via themes), 
and even functionality (via modules). But it also provides a solid foundation for developers
to contribute to an open community by offering their own solutions.

## What LCFramework is not

LCFramework is not an all-in-one CMS for your server. It provides a foundation that 
you, as a server owner (or developer), can build upon to create whatever you dream of 
for your server, using both community and closed-source modules and themes.

In fact, no themes or modules are provided out of the box. This is to minimise the bloat 
since every install of LCFramework likely has a different use-case and requirements.

That being said, we do provide some themes and modules. Their purpose is to provide 
functionality that's commonly needed across websites. They can also be used as examples 
of how to extend the framework.
