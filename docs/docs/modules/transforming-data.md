# Transforming data

LCFramework provides an API allowing developers to hook into "events" to transform
any data structure. For example, mutating content (such as forms) before displaying it 
on the front-end. The LCFramework core exposes an API allowing modules and themes to
transform core functionality without overwriting the core code.

::: warning
LCFramework is currently in `alpha` status. This means there may be bugs,
and the API may still change between minor versions.
