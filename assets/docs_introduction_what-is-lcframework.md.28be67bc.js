It&#39;s built on the <a href="https://laravel.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Laravel</a> framework, thus enabling you to utilise the same APIs and functionality that Laravel offers.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>LCFramework is currently in <code>alpha</code> status. This means there may be bugs, and the API may still change between minor versions.</p></div><h2 id="motivation" tabindex="-1">Motivation <a class="header-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>TL;DR - the LastChaos development scene is not welcoming to newcomers, and a lot of the material that is readily available, is built on ancient technologies and tools, resulting in critical vulnerabilities.</p><p>LCFramework was not only built to allow server owners to easily manage their own websites, enabling every site to have a unique appearance (via themes), and even functionality (via modules). But it also provides a solid foundation for developers to contribute to an open community by offering their own solutions.</p><h2 id="what-lcframework-is-not" tabindex="-1">What LCFramework is not <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-lcframework-is-not" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>LCFramework is not an all-in-one CMS for your server. It provides a foundation that you, as a server owner (or developer), can build upon to create whatever you dream of for your server, using both community and closed-source modules and themes.</p><p>In fact, no themes or modules are provided out of the box. This is to minimise the bloat since every install of LCFramework likely has a different use-case and requirements.</p><p>That being said, we do provide some themes and modules. Their purpose is to provide functionality that&#39;s commonly needed across websites. They can also be used as examples of how to extend the framework.</p>',10),i=[s];function n(l,d,c,h,m,u){return t(),a("div",null,i)}const w=e(r,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,w as default};
