Once you&#39;ve chosen a module that you wish to install onto your website, follow the steps outlined below:</p><ol><li>Go to the <code>Modules</code> page in the <a href="#">Administration panel</a> of your website. The url is likely similar to <code>https://yourdomain.com/admin/extend/modules</code>.</li><li>At the top of the page, you should see a button labelled &quot;Install modules&quot;. Clicking this button will prompt you with a modal that allows you to select the modules you wish to install. You can install more than one module at a time. Simply either drag-and-drop the module zip file you downloaded, or click to browse your filesystem.</li><li>Once you&#39;ve uploaded the modules you wish to install, click the &quot;Submit&quot; button at the bottom of the modal, and LCFramework will automatically unpack the modules you uploaded and install it for you.</li><li>LCFramework will notify you once all the modules you just uploaded have been installed.

Modules in the <code>Deleted</code> state are only for developers, and are never shown to the end-user.</p><p>A list of every module installed can be found on the <code>Modules</code> page in the <a href="#">Administration panel</a> of your website.
